# Day Planner
This planner has individual time slots for working hours in order to save tasks that need to be completed. You are able to leave the page and have your items stored and displayed the next time you come to the planner. The local time is displayed at the top and each time slot is color coded depending on if it is a past, present, or future time slot.
